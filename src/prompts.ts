2. For each identified technique, use mitre_get_technique to get full details
3. Map each technique to its tactics to understand the adversary's progression through the kill chain
4. Use mitre_mitigations_for_technique for each high-confidence technique to identify defensive measures
5. Use mitre_search_groups with the top techniques to identify potential threat actors
6. Compile a structured report with:
   - Identified techniques with confidence levels
   - Tactic coverage (which kill chain phases are represented)
   - Recommended mitigations prioritized by impact
   - Potential threat actor attribution (if patterns match known groups)
   - Detection gaps and recommended data sources to improve visibility`;
